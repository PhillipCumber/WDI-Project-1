This was the first project of my WDI bootcamp. I have created a jeopardy game. In this game I used a few outside javascript libraries. No, no bootstrap...I am not a fan of bootstrap at all. I like to create my own stuff. Here is a link to my page https://app.netlify.com/sites/awesome-poitras-8c95cc/overview.

Here is the link to my Trello board that contains my User Stories

My wireframe is attached to my github repo.
The list of libraries I used, were jquery, sweet alert js, and anime js.

I would like to add a player 2 in the future, and maybe a couple of difficulty levels.
