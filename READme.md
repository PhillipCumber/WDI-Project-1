JEOPARDY

Welcome to my simple game of Jeopardy. 
Below is a link to my one player version of the game. It has a fully functional scoring system that adds and subtract depending on if you get the answer right or wrong. 
Two daily doubles fixed with actual daily double audio.
Can answer in standard question form or non question form.

My wireframe is attached to my github repo.
The list of libraries I used, were jquery, sweet alert js, and anime js.

In the future I would like to add a 2nd player into the game.
